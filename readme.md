## Jellyfishing

This is a Fly Swatter game that I revamped as a Jellyfishing game! The premise is to get players to catch the jellyfish to power their trident.

Controls:
- Use the return, or enter, button to start the game and get to the game page.
- Use left, right, up, and down arrows to control the movement of the trident.
- Use the “Z” button to get to the end screen, which displays your final score. (Getting all 5 jellyfish will also lead you to the end screen)
- Use the delete, or backspace, button to get back to the start screen to restart the game.

As each jellyfish is caught by the trident, the jellyfish is removed from the screen and you get a point! Jellyfish can move at different speeds, which can make the game a bit tricky. So, there is an option to end early, but the goal is to get all jellyfish to “win”!

Enjoy!
